# Infinite Scroll

## Project Overview

This is a simple photo gallery website with a infinite scroll functionality so the user can scroll infinitely through the page while more photos are being loaded in the background before the bottom of the page is reached.

### Features

- **Display images**: photos fetched from a API.
- **Image links**: clicking on the photo will direct the user to the photo's website link. There, the user can see the photos details and also download it.
- **Infinite scroll functionality**: As the user scrolls near the bottom of the page, a network request will be made to load more images before reaching the bottom.
- **Responsive layout**: it is mobile responsive, so that way the user can use it on the mobile phone.
